## 📖 Introduction

"Vibe Coding" is not just about writing code; it's about managing the chaotic entropy of Large Language Models (LLMs). This project provides a **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** to help developers interact with AI efficiently, preventing "hallucination loops" and technical debt.

This application serves as both a **Documentation Site** for the methodology and an **Interactive Planner** that uses AI to break down your complex tasks into safe, atomic steps based on these strict rules.

## ✨ Features

- **Bilingual Support (EN/CN)**: Complete methodology available in English and Simplified Chinese.
- **Interactive Planner**: Built-in AI tool (powered by Gemini 2.5) that decomposes vague requirements into strict, execution-ready blueprints.
- **The 6-Phase SOP**:
  - **Phase 0: Mindset**: Habits over strict rules.
  - **Phase 1: Setup**: Greenfield vs. Legacy code strategies.
  - **Phase 2: Context**: How to stop hallucinations by restarting.
  - **Phase 3: Iteration**: The "Git Commit First" golden rule.
  - **Phase 4: Review**: Security and Logic audits.
  - **Phase 5: Closing**: The protocol for docs, polish, and debt repayment.
- **Visual Entropy Chart**: Visualizing why structure matters in AI coding sessions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons)
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **AI Integration**: Google GenAI SDK (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
- **Build Tooling**: Vite / Parcel (Implicit in environment)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- A valid [Google Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibe-coding-sop.git
    cd vibe-coding-sop
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure API Key**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

4.  **Run the application**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## 💡 How to Use the Planner

1.  Navigate to the **Toolkit / Workshop** tab.
2.  Select your preferred language (EN/CN) in the header.
3.  Enter a complex feature request (e.g., *"I need a user dashboard with real-time websocket updates and role-based access control"*).
4.  Click **Decompose Task**.
5.  The AI will generate a structured **Blueprint** containing:
    - **Step Title**: Action-oriented task name.
    - **Prompt Strategy**: Exactly what to tell the AI to avoid confusion.
    - **Risk Analysis**: What typically goes wrong in this specific step.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a new "Vibe Coding" habit or a correction to the SOP:

1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-habit`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add Phase 6: Deployment'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-habit`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) which can make mistakes. Always review the code and plans generated by AI. The SOP provided here is a guideline based on best practices, not a guarantee of bug-free code.
